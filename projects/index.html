    <h1>Chirag's Past Work</h1>
    <h3>Currently I am</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Working on AI for ambitious businesses who want to better understand their customers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Past Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Scaling <a href="https://whpk.org">WHPK 88.5 FM</a> in Chicago from being a small college radio with a couple hundred listeners at a time to having 20,000 a week.</li>
        <li>Research on natural language database querying with <a href="https://raulcastrofernandez.com/">Dr. Raul Castro Fernandez</a>.</li>
        <li>Some trading bots on Kalshi. One netted a 98% return betting on TSA wait times.</li>
        <li>BuzzPay, an app to automate ordering drinks at bars, increasing sales by 4x for a few bars in Chicago that used it. Regulatory issues forced us to shut it down.</li>
        <li>At 16, I started working on RoboTutor at CMU, using speech recognition to help Tanzanian students learn English. We were finalists for the $15M Global Learning XPRIZE.</li>
