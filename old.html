                <p>
                    Welcome to my website. I'm Chirag, an undergraduate at <a href="https://uchicago.edu">UChicago</a>, studying
                    mathematics and computer science. I'm an aspiring product manager with experience as a software engineer. I'm
                    passionate about delivering interesting and impactful products to end users, and am skilled in translating
                    human problems into machine ones. My area of focus has been in data science and data infrastructure, particularly
                    in the context of machine learning.

                    I am currently working with <a href="https://raulcastrofernandez.com">Dr. Raul Castro Fernandez</a>
                    in the ChiData research group at UChicago on the <a
                        href="https://raulcastrofernandez.com/papers/ver.pdf">Ver</a> project,
                    focused on finding views in an interactive, general way by profiling data efficiently. We recently
                    <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626246.3654748">published a demo</a> of the project. What
                    I liked about it is that it's user-first, and practical. Despite this,
                    it remains at the forefront of database engineering. It is a demonstration of my belief that there
                    isn't really a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeqPrUmVz-o&ab_channel=JonathanField">divide between engineers and users,</a> just a lack of communication.

                    I am the Program Director for <a href="https://whpk.org">WHPK</a>, the University of Chicago's
                    community radio station.
                    I am also a DJ, web developer, board member, and the international music format chief. When I DJ
                    on the radio, I especially like to play electronic music, but you'll hear a little bit of everything on my show.
                    Tune in in the fall to hear me on the airwaves.
