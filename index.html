        <p style="margin-top: 0px !important; color: #555555" ><i>Palo Alto, CA</i></p>

        <p>I'm a 22-year old cofounder of Dough.
            I studied math and cs at <a href="https://uchicago.edu">UChicago</a> and wrote software at <a href="https://www.draper.com">Draper Labs</a>, but
            recently decided to move to the bay area with my friends with <!-- Amogh and <a href="https://www.skylerji.com/">Skyler</a> -->
            the help of <a href="https://www.ovofund.com/">Ovo Fund</a>. 
        </p>

        <p>In a past life, I was focused on government policy. I was a nationally ranked debater and worked for the Chief of Staff (then Christopher Davis) at the Department of Energy, preparing briefs for the White House.
        </p>
        <p>College was a time of deep introspection. I went from getting B's in high school calculus to acing PhD systems courses and mastering real analysis. I loved the academic rigor of UChicago. <b>But I am now here to build.</b></p>
