        <p>I'm a 22-year old cofounder of Dough.
            I studied math and cs at <a href="https://uchicago.edu">UChicago</a> and wrote software at <a href="https://www.draper.com">Draper Labs</a>, but
            recently decided to move to the bay area with my friends with <!-- Amogh and <a href="https://www.skylerji.com/">Skyler</a> -->
            the help of <a href="https://www.ovofund.com/">Ovo Fund</a>. 
        </p>

        <p>In a past life, I was focused on government policy. I was a nationally ranked debater and worked for the Chief of Staff (then Christopher Davis) at the Department of Energy, preparing briefs for the White House.
        </p>
        <p>College was a time of deep introspection. I went from getting B's in high school calculus to taking PhD systems courses and mastering real analysis. I loved the academic rigor of UChicago. <b>But I am now here to build.</b></p>

    <h3>Currently I am</h3>

        <li>Working on AI for ambitious businesses who want to better understand their customers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Past Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Scaling <a href="https://whpk.org">WHPK 88.5 FM</a> in Chicago from being a small college radio with a couple hundred listeners at a time to having 20,000 a week.</li>
        <li>Research on natural language database querying with <a href="https://raulcastrofernandez.com/">Dr. Raul Castro Fernandez</a>.</li>
        <li>Some trading bots on Kalshi. One netted a 98% return betting on TSA wait times.</li>
        <li>BuzzPay, an app to automate ordering drinks at bars, increasing sales by 4x for a few bars in Chicago that used it. Regulatory issues forced us to shut it down.</li>
        <li>At 16, I started working on RoboTutor at CMU, using speech recognition to help Tanzanian students learn English. We were finalists for the $15M Global Learning XPRIZE.</li>
